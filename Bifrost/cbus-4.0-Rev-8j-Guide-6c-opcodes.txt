# Author: Richard Crawshaw
#
# Lines starting with hash, semi-colon, exclamation mark (bang) or double forward slash, double dash (#;!//--) are comments and are ignored.
#
# Lines other than comments have a prefix word that indicates the overall format and function of the line.
# These words are as follows:
#	*	Licence:	Denotes the text of the licence that the data in this file and files generated from it are bound by.
#	*	History:	Denotes the history of the data in this file. 
#					Whenever this file is updated a new history entry is to be added.
#					The format of a history entry is "History", date in year-month-day format, author, text.
#					The text should briefly describe the change.
#	*	Comment:	Denotes text that is to be included as comments in the generated files
#					Typically these would be triple-slashed and wrapped in <summary></summary> tags.
#	*	opcode:		Describes the opcodes.
#					There are a number of sub-prefixes under 'opcode': these are as follows:
#		-	reserved:	Indicates that the opcode is reserved for future expansion.
#						There is no further information included, though additional text can be appended to the line: it is ignored.
#		-	values:		This is the meta-data about the opcode.
#						The format is: "opcode",Value (hex),"values",Code,Name,Priority,Group
#						Code is the short-form code; name is a full-name.
#						Group is one of the following: Accessory, DCC, Config, General.
#		-	description:	A full text description of the opcode.
#							Format: "opcode",Value (hex),"description",Text
#							Text contains the text of the actual description.
#		-	property:	Details of the properties that are exposed by the individual opcode.
#						Format: "opcode",Value (hex),"property",Source,Name
#						Source describes where the value is in the data bytes that are received or transmitted.
#						The format is a list of the byte numbers; if there are only some bits used then these follow a colon.
#		-	tostring:	Defines the ToString interpolated string to use in the overridden ToString() method.
#						Format: # "opcode",Value (hex),"tostring",Format-string
#		-	comment:	Denotes text that is to be included as comments applied to the opcode.
#						Typically these would be triple-slashed and included in the <summary></summary> tags.
#	*	property:	Defines the properties that are exposed by the opcodes.
#					Format: "property",Name,DataType
#					The name matches with the name of the property defined by the opcode property.
#					The datatype is either a built-in .NET datatype (int, short, byte, char, bool, etc.) or a defined enumeration.
#	*	enumeration:	Defines an enumeration of the individual values in a byte (or possibly multiple bytes).
#						These are referenced by the 'property' lines, where they define which enum to use.
#	*	Version		Denotes a single version string that should uniquely identify the CBUS version that this file reflects.
#					If there are multiple Version lines then the file should be considered invalid.
#	*	responses:	Defines the relationship between op-codes, specifically which are responses to others.
#					Format: "responses",request-opcode,response-opcode,type,comment
#					The "request-opcode" is the opcode that is send and the "response-opcode" is the one that is returned.
#					"type" is either "normal" for most situations, or "error" for those responses that indicate an error situation.
#					"comment" is some explanatory text that will be added as a comment to the generated code.
